En toda actividad curricular, la nota final se expresará hasta con un decimal y será la resultante del promedio ponderado de las calificaciones correspondientes a los procedimientos evaluativos aplicados. Cuando la asignatura requiera la aprobación por separado de las actividades de Cátedra y actividades de carácter práctico (laboratorio, taller, terreno, u otra), y cualquiera de éstas no alcance la nota mínima para aprobar, entonces la calificación final de la asignatura será reemplazado por un 3,3 como nota reprobatoria, sin derecho a examen recuperativo.	{"page": 13, "source": "C:\\\\Users\\\\claud\\\\Desktop\\\\Cursos\\\\LearningLangChain\\\\ChatBotUCN\\\\mapping\\\\media\\\\PDF\\\\Reglamento-General-de-Docencia-de-Pregrado-2024-2.pdf"}

asignaturas con aprobación independiente de componentes deberán estar especificadas en los programas de asignaturas contenidos en el libro de carrera o programa respectivo y configuradas por la unidad académica en el proceso de generación de la oferta académica. Art. 30. La nota mínima de aprobación de cada actividad curricular es 4,0 (cuatro coma cero), considerando un porcentaje de exigencia de un 60% (sesenta por ciento). Sin perjuicio de lo anterior, cada carrera o programa podrá definir un porcentaje de exigencia distinto para determinadas actividades curriculares (siempre y cuando no sea inferior a lo ya establecido en este reglamento), las cuales deberán estar explicitadas en el respectivo libro de carrera o en el reglamento Interno que corresponda. Como requisito adicional para la aprobación de toda asignatura, cada estudiante deberá cumplir con un porcentaje mínimo de asistencia: a) Tratándose de asignaturas del ciclo básico, el porcentaje mínimo de asistencia será determinado por la unidad académica que dicta la asignatura el cual deberá estar especificado en el programa de asignatura. Solo se aceptará rebajar este porcentaje mínimo en caso de enfermedades graves o motivos de fuerza mayor, debidamente acreditados. Con todo, aun en caso de enfermedad grave o motivo de fuerza mayor, el porcentaje mínimo de asistencia no podrá ser inferior a 50% (cincuenta por ciento). Tratándose de estudiantes madres o padres debidamente acreditados (MAPAU), que no puedan cumplir el porcentaje de asistencia exigida, u otros casos especiales, se regirán por el instructivo específico para estos efectos. a) Tratándose de asignaturas de ciclo profesional, la unidad académica respectiva definira el porcentaje mínimo de asistencia requerida para la aprobación de cada actividad curricular.

Estudiantes regulares podrán acogerse al beneficio de anular todas las actividades curriculares inscritas durante el periodo académico que se encuentra cursando hasta en dos oportunidades a lo largo de sus estudios. En consecuencia, se anularán todas las actividades curriculares inscritas en el caso que las hubiere y las calificaciones asociadas a éstas. El plazo de presentación de solicitudes de anulación está determinado en el calendario de actividades docentes y debe realizarse en el departamento de gestión académica y curricular en Antofagasta y en el departamento de registro curricular en Coquimbo según corresponda, a través del sistema de trámites curriculares. Debe indicar el motivo de la anulación. En este tipo de interrupción de estudios, cada estudiante mantiene su condición de alumno/a regular. Sin embargo, no está autorizado a realizar en este periodo prácticas profesionales o cualquier otra actividad curricular. Art. 42. Se entenderá por retiro temporal la interrupción de los estudios por periodos académicos completos. Cada estudiante podrá acogerse a retiro temporal antes del inicio de las actividades académicas de cada semestre. Esta solicitud podrá realizarla por uno, dos o tres semestres a lo largo de su carrera, ya sea de manera parcializada o consecutiva a través del sistema de trámites curriculares de la institución. Para acogerse al derecho de retiro temporal, el estudiantado no debe tener situaciones de deuda pendiente de ninguna índole con la Universidad, haber cursado más de un año de estudios en la Universidad y no estar afecto a eliminación. Durante la vigencia del retiro temporal, el estudiante quedará exento del pago de matrícula. Al término del retiro temporal, cualquiera fuere el tiempo autorizado, cada estudiante deberá reintegrarse a la Universidad, adscribiéndose al plan de estudios vigente de la carrera o programa que cursa. De lo contrario quedará afecto a eliminación.	{"page": 19, "source": "C:\\\\Users\\\\claud\\\\Desktop\\\\Cursos\\\\LearningLangChain\\\\ChatBotUCN\\\\mapping\\\\media\\\\PDF\\\\Reglamento-General-de-Docencia-de-Pregrado-2024-2.pdf"}

Los aspectos que regulan la movilidad estudiantil son detallados en el Reglamento de Movilidad estudiantil UCN. TÍTULO XIV Convalidaciones y homologaciones Art. 61. Se entenderá por convalidación de asignaturas el reconocimiento por parte de la Universidad Católica del Norte, de la equivalencia entre materias cursadas y aprobadas por el estudiantado de ésta u otra Universidad o Institución acreditada. En el caso de que otras instituciones utilicen otro sistema de calificaciones distinto a la UCN, deberá aplicarse la tabla de equivalencias respectiva para el cálculo de la nota. Cuando una carrera inicie actividades en un nuevo plan de estudios, se entenderá por homologación al reconocimiento de aquellas asignaturas aprobadas en el plan de estudios que cursaba el estudiante, y que son reconocidas en el plan de estudios actual a través de una tabla de convalidaciones. Art. 62. La solicitud de convalidación o de homologación de asignaturas será presentada en el departamento de gestión académica y curricular en Antofagasta o el departamento de registro curricular en Coquimbo, según corresponda a través del sistema de trámites curriculares. Deberá ser acompañada por un certificado de calificaciones y de los programas debidamente oficializados de las asignaturas que se desea convalidar. Art. 63. El análisis y recomendación de la convalidación solicitada por el estudiantado será efectuada por la unidad académica que dicta la asignatura, considerando la equivalencia entre el programa de la asignatura en estudio y el programa cursado. La equivalencia requerida para la convalidación debe ser igual o superior al 75% \n(setenta y cinco por ciento). Para el cálculo de dicho porcentaje se tomarán en cuenta los aspectos de SCT, resultados de aprendizajes, contenidos,	{"page": 27, "source": "C:\\\\Users\\\\claud\\\\Desktop\\\\Cursos\\\\LearningLangChain\\\\ChatBotUCN\\\\mapping\\\\media\\\\PDF\\\\Reglamento-General-de-Docencia-de-Pregrado-2024-2.pdf"}
