aprobación independiente de componentes deberán estar especificadas en los programas de asignaturas contenidos en el libro de carrera o programa respectivo y configuradas por la unidad académica en el proceso de generación de la oferta académica. Art. 30. La nota mínima de aprobación de cada actividad curricular es 4,0 (cuatro coma cero), considerando un porcentaje de exigencia de un 60% (sesenta por ciento). Sin perjuicio de lo anterior, cada carrera o programa podrá definir un porcentaje de exigencia distinto para determinadas actividades curriculares (siempre y cuando no sea inferior a lo ya establecido en este reglamento), las cuales deberán estar explicitadas en el respectivo libro de carrera o en el reglamento Interno que corresponda. Como requisito adicional para la aprobación de toda asignatura, cada estudiante deberá cumplir con un porcentaje mínimo de asistencia: a) Tratándose de asignaturas del ciclo básico, el porcentaje mínimo de asistencia será determinado por la unidad académica que dicta la asignatura el cual deberá estar especificado en el programa de asignatura. Solo se aceptará rebajar este porcentaje mínimo en caso de enfermedades graves o motivos de fuerza mayor, debidamente acreditados. Con todo, aun en caso de enfermedad grave o motivo de fuerza mayor, el porcentaje mínimo de asistencia no podrá ser inferior a 50% (cincuenta por ciento). Tratándose de estudiantes madres o padres debidamente acreditados (MAPAU), que no puedan cumplir el porcentaje de asistencia exigida, u otros casos especiales, se regirán por el instructivo específico para estos efectos. a) Tratándose de asignaturas de ciclo profesional, la unidad académica respectiva definirá el porcentaje mínimo de asistencia requerida para la aprobación de cada actividad curricular. Esta definición deberá ser especificada en los programas de asignaturas. b) El porcentaje mínimo de asistencia a laboratorios u otras actividades de carácter práctico, será de un 100% (cien por ciento).

Se entenderá por convalidación de asignaturas el reconocimiento por parte de la Universidad Católica del Norte, de la equivalencia entre materias cursadas y aprobadas por el estudiantado de ésta u otra Universidad o Institución acreditada. En el caso de que otras instituciones utilicen otro sistema de calificaciones distinto a la UCN, deberá aplicarse la tabla de equivalencias respectiva para el cálculo de la nota. Cuando una carrera inicie actividades en un nuevo plan de estudios, se entenderá por homologación al reconocimiento de aquellas asignaturas aprobadas en el plan de estudios que cursaba el estudiante, y que son reconocidas en el plan de estudios actual a través de una tabla de convalidaciones. Art. 62. La solicitud de convalidación o de homologación de asignaturas será presentada en el departamento de gestión académica y curricular en Antofagasta o el departamento de registro curricular en Coquimbo, según corresponda a través del sistema de trámites curriculares. Deberá ser acompañada por un certificado de calificaciones y de los programas debidamente oficializados de las asignaturas que se desea convalidar. Art. 63. El análisis y recomendación de la convalidación solicitada por el estudiantado será efectuada por la unidad académica que dicta la asignatura, considerando la equivalencia entre el programa de la asignatura en estudio y el programa cursado. La equivalencia requerida para la convalidación debe ser igual o superior al 75% (setenta y cinco por ciento). Para el cálculo de dicho porcentaje se tomarán en cuenta los aspectos de SCT, resultados de aprendizajes, contenidos, competencias y exigencias, así como el año en que éstas hubiesen sido aprobadas. Estudiantes que realicen actividades extracurriculares que se encuentren alineadas con el PEI, podrán solicitar la convalidación de éstas por una asignatura de Formación General Electiva de su carrera a través del sistema de trámites curriculares.
