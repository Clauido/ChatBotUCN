Deberá ser acompañada por un certificado de calificaciones y de los programas debidamente oficializados de las asignaturas que se desea convalidar. Art. 63. El análisis y recomendación de la convalidación solicitada por el estudiantado será efectuada por la unidad académica que dicta la asignatura, considerando la equivalencia entre el programa de la asignatura en estudio y el programa cursado. La equivalencia requerida para la convalidación debe ser igual o superior al 75% (setenta y cinco por ciento). Para el cálculo de dicho porcentaje se tomarán en cuenta los aspectos de SCT, resultados de aprendizajes, contenidos, competencias y exigencias, así como el año en que éstas hubiesen sido aprobadas. Estudiantes que realicen actividades extracurriculares que se encuentren alineadas con el PEI, podrán solicitar la convalidación de éstas por una asignatura de Formación General Electiva de su carrera a través del sistema de trámites curriculares. La Dirección General de Pregrado en Antofagasta y la secretaria de pregrado y estudiantil en Coquimbo según corresponda, evaluarán y resolverán la solicitud. Art. 64.
