Escuela o Unidad dependiente de la Vicerrectoría Académica o de Sede, o en el libro de carrera o programa respectivo. Art. 17. Cada plan de estudios deberá ser sometido a seguimiento y evaluación permanente por el comité curricular de la carrera o programa conforme a los procedimientos de seguimiento y evaluación del currículo. El seguimiento del currículo deberá realizarse de forma anual y la evaluación del currículo, deberá realizarse con una periodicidad no mayor a la duración de la carrera. De estas evaluaciones podrán surgir tres tipos de propuestas de cambio. Estos son: a) Modificaciones menores al Plan de Estudios. Éstos no afectan el perfil de egreso de la carrera. En este contexto, los cambios serán aprobados en el Consejo de Carrera y posteriormente por la Dirección General de Pregrado y la Vicerrectoría Académica. b) Modificaciones mayores al Plan de estudio que no afecten al perfil de egreso de la carrera. Estos cambios deberán ser aprobados primero por el Consejo de Carrera, ratificados por el Consejo de Facultad o de escuela, luego por la Dirección General de Pregrado y finalmente por la Vicerrectoría Académica. c) Rediseños curriculares: Afectan el perfil de egreso de la carrera. Estos cambios deberán ser aprobados primero por el Consejo de carrera, ratificados por el Consejo de Facultad o escuela, luego por la Dirección General de Pregrado y finalmente por la Vicerrectoría Académica. Los procedimientos para realizar modificaciones menores y mayores estarán reguladas a través de un instructivo emanado por la Vicerrectoría Académica. Si las modificaciones que se introduzcan involucran un cambio de estructura curricular del plan de estudios, en ningún caso se podrá afectar el avance curricular de estudiantes, es decir, no podrán afectar el tiempo de permanencia restante que estaba proyectado, a menos que se acepte formalmente	{"source": "./media/markdown/Reglamento-General-de-Docencia-de-Pregrado-2024-2/Reglamento-General-de-Docencia-de-Pregrado-2024-2.md"}

Como requisito adicional para la aprobación de toda asignatura, cada estudiante deberá cumplir con un porcentaje mínimo de asistencia: a) Tratándose de asignaturas del ciclo básico, el porcentaje mínimo de asistencia será determinado por la unidad académica que dicta la asignatura el cual deberá estar especificado en el programa de asignatura. Solo se aceptará rebajar este porcentaje mínimo en caso de enfermedades graves o motivos de fuerza mayor, debidamente acreditados. Con todo, aun en caso de enfermedad grave o motivo de fuerza mayor, el porcentaje mínimo de asistencia no podrá ser inferior a 50% (cincuenta por ciento). Tratándose de estudiantes madres o padres debidamente acreditados (MAPAU), que no puedan cumplir el porcentaje de asistencia exigida, u otros casos especiales, se regirán por el instructivo específico para estos efectos. a) Tratándose de asignaturas de ciclo profesional, la unidad académica respectiva definirá el porcentaje mínimo de asistencia requerida para la aprobación de cada actividad curricular.

Art. 34. Las actividades curriculares reprobadas por inasistencia a clases, tendrán una nota final de 3,3 (tres coma tres). Art. 35. Si existiese la necesidad de modificar una nota posterior al cierre del semestre, estos se podrán realizar durante el periodo de rectificación de notas, establecido en el calendario de actividades docentes, por el encargado docente de la unidad. Art. 36. Se entenderá por Promedio Ponderado Acumulado (PPA) el cociente entre la sumatoria del producto de la nota final de cada asignatura por el número de créditos de ésta, y el total de créditos de todas las asignaturas cursadas. PPA $$ PPA = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(N_i \\cdot C_i)}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} C_i} $$ Donde: n es la cantidad total de asignaturas cursadas. N_i es la calificación final obtenida la última vez que se cursó la asignatura i. C_i son los créditos SCT de la asignatura i. Para este cálculo se consideran todas las asignaturas cursadas; es decir, las asignaturas aprobadas y las reprobadas, estas últimas considerando la última vez que fue cursada y sólo mientras no sean aprobadas. TITULO VIII Asignaturas por Tutoría y Examen Art. 37. Tutoría es una actividad curricular de carácter teórica en la que un docente asesora el estudio individual o grupal de un máximo de cinco estudiantes. Se excluyen de esta modalidad asignaturas que tengan componente práctico (taller, laboratorio, prácticas clínicas, etc). Su régimen es de excepción y debe regirse por el programa de la asignatura. Los requerimientos, resultados de aprendizajes y nivel de exigencia de la tutoría serán los mismos de la asignatura dictada en forma regular. Cada estudiante debe solicitar la tutoría en el Departamento de Gestión académica y curricular en Antofaqasta y en el Departamento de Registro Curricular en Coquimbo, según corresponda. La unidad académica que dicta la asignatura, podrá autorizar la inscripción de una asignatura en régimen de tutoría, previo un informe favorable de la jefatura de carrera en	{"source": "./media/markdown/Reglamento-General-de-Docencia-de-Pregrado-2024-2/Reglamento-General-de-Docencia-de-Pregrado-2024-2.md"}

Se entenderá por convalidación de asignaturas el reconocimiento por parte de la Universidad Católica del Norte, de la equivalencia entre materias cursadas y aprobadas por el estudiantado de ésta u otra Universidad o Institución acreditada. En el caso de que otras instituciones utilicen otro sistema de calificaciones distinto a la UCN, deberá aplicarse la tabla de equivalencias respectiva para el cálculo de la nota. Cuando una carrera inicie actividades en un nuevo plan de estudios, se entenderá por homologación al reconocimiento de aquellas asignaturas aprobadas en el plan de estudios que cursaba el estudiante, y que son reconocidas en el plan de estudios actual a través de una tabla de convalidaciones. Art. 62. La solicitud de convalidación o de homologación de asignaturas será presentada en el departamento de gestión académica y curricular en Antofagasta o el departamento de registro curricular en Coquimbo, según corresponda a través del sistema de trámites curriculares. Deberá ser acompañada por un certificado de calificaciones y de los programas debidamente oficializados de las asignaturas que se desea convalidar. Art. 63. El análisis y recomendación de la convalidación solicitada por el estudiantado será efectuada por la unidad académica que dicta la asignatura, considerando la equivalencia entre el programa de la asignatura en estudio y el programa cursado. La equivalencia requerida para la convalidación debe ser igual o superior al 75% (setenta y cinco por ciento). Para el cálculo de dicho porcentaje se tomarán en cuenta los aspectos de SCT, resultados de aprendizajes, contenidos, competencias y exigencias, así como el año en que éstas hubiesen sido aprobadas. Estudiantes que realicen actividades extracurriculares que se encuentren alineadas con el PEI, podrán solicitar la convalidación de éstas por una asignatura de Formación General Electiva de su carrera a través del sistema de trámites curriculares.
