las modificaciones que se introduzcan involucran un cambio de estructura curricular del plan de estudios, en ning√∫n caso se podr√° afectar el avance curricular de estudiantes, es decir, no podr√°n

T√çTULO V Sistema de Cr√©ditos Transferibles (SCT) Art. 18. Con el fin de permitir una carga de trabajo que regule el avance del estudiantado, y una distribuci√≥n adecuada de las exigencias de cada asignatura y de su dedicaci√≥n, dicha carga de trabajo estar√° expresada a trav√©s del Sistema de Cr√©ditos Transferibles (SCT). El cr√©dito es la expresi√≥n cuantitativa de la carga de trabajo acad√©mico que realiza el estudiante y considera las horas directas y las de trabajo aut√≥nomo. La asignaci√≥n de cr√©ditos transferibles por asignatura y por semestre acad√©mico se ajustar√° a los siguientes valores de referencia: 1. N√∫mero de semanas del semestre: 17 semanas. 2. N√∫mero de horas cronol√≥gicas totales como carga de trabajo de un o una estudiante a la semana: 50 horas. 3. N√∫mero de horas semestrales de trabajo: 850 horas. 4.

En toda actividad curricular, la nota final se expresar√° hasta con un decimal y ser√° la resultante del promedio ponderado de las calificaciones correspondientes a los procedimientos evaluativos aplicados. Cuando la asignatura requiera la aprobaci√≥n por separado de las actividades de C√°tedra y actividades de car√°cter pr√°ctico (laboratorio, taller, terreno, u otra), y cualquiera de √©stas no alcance la nota m√≠nima para aprobar, entonces la calificaci√≥n final de la asignatura ser√° reemplazado por un 3,3 como nota reprobatoria, sin derecho a examen recuperativo.	{"page": 13, "source": "C:\\\\Users\\\\claud\\\\Desktop\\\\Cursos\\\\LearningLangChain\\\\ChatBotUCN\\\\mapping\\\\media\\\\PDF\\\\Reglamento-General-de-Docencia-de-Pregrado-2024-2.pdf"}

asignaturas con aprobaci√≥n independiente de componentes deber√°n estar especificadas en los programas de asignaturas contenidos en el libro de carrera o programa respectivo y configuradas por la unidad acad√©mica en el proceso de generaci√≥n de la oferta acad√©mica. Art. 30. La nota m√≠nima de aprobaci√≥n de cada actividad curricular es 4,0 (cuatro coma cero), considerando un porcentaje de exigencia de un 60% (sesenta por ciento). Sin perjuicio de lo anterior, cada carrera o programa podr√° definir un porcentaje de exigencia distinto para determinadas actividades curriculares (siempre y cuando no sea inferior a lo ya establecido en este reglamento), las cuales deber√°n estar explicitadas en el respectivo libro de carrera o en el reglamento Interno que corresponda. Como requisito adicional para la aprobaci√≥n de toda asignatura, cada estudiante deber√° cumplir con un porcentaje m√≠nimo de asistencia: a) Trat√°ndose de asignaturas del ciclo b√°sico, el porcentaje m√≠nimo de asistencia ser√° determinado por la unidad acad√©mica que dicta la asignatura el cual deber√° estar especificado en el programa de asignatura. Solo se aceptar√° rebajar este porcentaje m√≠nimo en caso de enfermedades graves o motivos de fuerza mayor, debidamente acreditados. Con todo, aun en caso de enfermedad grave o motivo de fuerza mayor, el porcentaje m√≠nimo de asistencia no podr√° ser inferior a 50% (cincuenta por ciento). Trat√°ndose de estudiantes madres o padres debidamente acreditados (MAPAU), que no puedan cumplir el porcentaje de asistencia exigida, u otros casos especiales, se regir√°n por el instructivo espec√≠fico para estos efectos. a) Trat√°ndose de asignaturas de ciclo profesional, la unidad acad√©mica respectiva definira el porcentaje m√≠nimo de asistencia requerida para la aprobaci√≥n de cada actividad curricular. Esta definici√≥n deber√° ser especificada en los programas de asignaturas. . b) El porcentaje m√≠nimo de asistencia a laboratorios u otras actividades de car√°cter pr√°ctico, ser√° de un 100% (cien	{"page": 14, "source": "C:\\\\Users\\\\claud\\\\Desktop\\\\Cursos\\\\LearningLangChain\\\\ChatBotUCN\\\\mapping\\\\media\\\\PDF\\\\Reglamento-General-de-Docencia-de-Pregrado-2024-2.pdf"}

Los aspectos que regulan la movilidad estudiantil son detallados en el Reglamento de Movilidad estudiantil UCN. T√çTULO XIV Convalidaciones y homologaciones Art. 61. Se entender√° por convalidaci√≥n de asignaturas el reconocimiento por parte de la Universidad Cat√≥lica del Norte, de la equivalencia entre materias cursadas y aprobadas por el estudiantado de √©sta u otra Universidad o Instituci√≥n acreditada. En el caso de que otras instituciones utilicen otro sistema de calificaciones distinto a la UCN, deber√° aplicarse la tabla de equivalencias respectiva para el c√°lculo de la nota. Cuando una carrera inicie actividades en un nuevo plan de estudios, se entender√° por homologaci√≥n al reconocimiento de aquellas asignaturas aprobadas en el plan de estudios que cursaba el estudiante, y que son reconocidas en el plan de estudios actual a trav√©s de una tabla de convalidaciones. Art. 62. La solicitud de convalidaci√≥n o de homologaci√≥n de asignaturas ser√° presentada en el departamento de gesti√≥n acad√©mica y curricular en Antofagasta o el departamento de registro curricular en Coquimbo, seg√∫n corresponda a trav√©s del sistema de tr√°mites curriculares. Deber√° ser acompa√±ada por un certificado de calificaciones y de los programas debidamente oficializados de las asignaturas que se desea convalidar. Art. 63. El an√°lisis y recomendaci√≥n de la convalidaci√≥n solicitada por el estudiantado ser√° efectuada por la unidad acad√©mica que dicta la asignatura, considerando la equivalencia entre el programa de la asignatura en estudio y el programa cursado. La equivalencia requerida para la convalidaci√≥n debe ser igual o superior al 75% \n(setenta y cinco por ciento). Para el c√°lculo de dicho porcentaje se tomar√°n en cuenta los aspectos de SCT, resultados de aprendizajes, contenidos,	{"page": 27, "source": "C:\\\\Users\\\\claud\\\\Desktop\\\\Cursos\\\\LearningLangChain\\\\ChatBotUCN\\\\mapping\\\\media\\\\PDF\\\\Reglamento-General-de-Docencia-de-Pregrado-2024-2.pdf"}
